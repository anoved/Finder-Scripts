# Finder Scripts

AppleScripts for use with the Mac OS X Finder. Intended to be installed in `~/Library/Scripts/Finder/` and invoked with a script runner such as [FastScripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/) (or however you prefer to invoke scripts). Largely unmaintained; however, pull requests with ready-to-go fixes or improvements are welcome.
